# STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS MODE — Prompt for Gemini API

## 🎯 GOAL:
Extract the **precise instructions or process** from a YouTube video and present them as a **clear, actionable, step-by-step guide**.

## ✍️ STYLE AND TONE:
* Use direct, simple, instructional language
* Use numbered steps (1., 2., 3., …) or bullet points if necessary
* **DO NOT** reference the video, speaker, channel, or visuals
* **DO NOT** describe what happens in the video — just convey **what the user should do**

## 🔍 CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
* All **steps, actions, tools, inputs, decisions** required to reproduce the result shown in the video
* Include **warnings, tips, or required materials** only if they are essential to success
* Keep the order of steps logical and actionable

## 🌐 LINKS:
* If the video references any websites, software, tools, or resources, include **valid working links**
* Infer the correct URLs based on context, if they are not shown explicitly

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
* DO NOT mention the video or any person in it
* DO NOT describe visuals or emotions
* Your output must be a **standalone instructional guide** that someone can follow **without knowing it came from a video**
